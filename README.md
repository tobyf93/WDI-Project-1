#Project Description
The 'original' DeadDrops concept originated in New York (2010) by a Berlin-based artist by the name of Aram Bartholl.  It involved planting USB's in public locations using fast-setting concrete.  For more info on the original idea see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_dead_drop.

Using HTML5 geolocation technologies i decided to recreate DeadDrops as a cloud-based service.  Users can visit a location and view media files (that are within a 100m radius) that other users have dropped as well as publishing their own.  Each media item is pinned on a heatmap using a precise latitude/longitude.
